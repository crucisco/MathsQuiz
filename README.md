# MathsQuiz

I created MathsQuiz has a quick exercise in AngularJS with .Net MVC and a SQL Server backend.  The purpose (in addition to learning the technology was to help my kids improve mental arithmetic skills.

I still play it from time to time myself - you can try it out at [http://mathsquiz.azurewebsites.net/](MathsQuiz).
